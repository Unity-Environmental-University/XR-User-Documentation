Welcome to the **Dog Park**, an immersive simulation game designed to educate players on the art of canine behavior understanding.
Our game teaches you how to identify and reward desired behaviors in real dogs, using Ajax - your virtual training partner - as a guide.
Through interactive exercises and scenarios, you'll learn valuable lessons on effective communication techniques, patience, consistency,
and rewarding good behavior - skills essential for every dog owner or trainer working with live animals.
