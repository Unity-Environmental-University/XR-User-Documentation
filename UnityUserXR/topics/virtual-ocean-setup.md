## Getting Started with Virtual Ocean

Once you have downloaded and installed the Virtual Ocean,
***[WATCH THIS VIDEO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Q-R9I7mUGC7Iy836C6Tk_kLMZjaQXrN/view?usp=sharing)*** for more
information about how to
use it.

## Simulation Controls

> We ***HIGHLY*** recommend that you use a mouse for all simulations.
> {style=warning}

- Choose either _Practice_ or _Assessment mode_.
- In **Practice mode**, you will be able to move the ship in any direction, and you will receive feedback each time you
  identify the species of whale and the distance from the ship.
- In **Assessment mode**, you will only be able to move the ship forward along a transect, and you will not receive
  feedback after you identify each whale.
- Camera Movement — Use the mouse to control the camera movement.
- Ship Movement — Use the WASD or the arrow keys to move the ship.
  Left and right movement are only available in
  Practice mode.
- Identify and Count Whales, to see your arrow and click on a whale, *RIGHT-CLICK* on the screen.
  This will
  lock your view in place and allow you to see your arrow and click on any whale or item on the screen.
  Right click again to move your view.
- Click on "MENU" in the lower left-hand corner to return to the main menu at any time.

## Identifying and Counting Whales

- When you click on a whale, you will be prompted to identify the species of whale and the distance from the ship.
  Your total count will appear in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.
